This is a tiny project to override (and make) the styles of markdown documents formatted on GitHub better.

## Usage.

You can use just a code of override.css as any methods to override CSS on your favorite web browser locally.

###For instance...

#### For Safari
- [User CSS](http://code.grid.in.th)

You can set params of URL with wild card, "https://github.com/*" for instance.  
And you can browse markdown documents on GitHub based on the styles defined by your own such "override.css".

#### For Chrome

Sorry that I have no idea how to use custom css with chrome.  
However, you can absolutely find some plugins which work for overriding css well.
